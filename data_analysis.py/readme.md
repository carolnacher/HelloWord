# Overview

This is a project that seeks to extract relevant information from collected real-world e-commerce data. The data used in the research is a dataset taken from all sales transactions on the Amazon platform over four years. My goal was to deepen my understanding of this field so I could then interact with the data, visualize potential strengths and weaknesses through graphs, and then inform business decision-making through analysis of the collected data.

# Data Analysis Results

List of questions:
-How do sales vary depending on the time of year?
    -Sales increase in September, November, and the last quarter of the year. This could be related to end-of-year promotions, Black Friday, and pre-holiday shopping.
-Which customer segment (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office) buys the most?
    - According to the data collected, we can highlight that the segments with the highest sales are: 1st consumer, with the highest sales, 2nd corporate, and 3rd home office.
-Which products generate more (or less) profit?
    -The top 10 products with the highest losses are 3D printers, conference tables, and simple printers,     possibly  due to their high costs. The top 10 with the highest profits are copiers, professional printers, and binders.

# Future Work

* Improvement: Add a seasonal trend analysis. This would help determine which products should have more visibility for better sales results.
* To fix: it would be the visual of the graphics since it shows the entire name of the product
