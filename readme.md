# Overview

Hello Word week 01 assigment 

This software was developed to ensure a functional and operational development environment. The program consists of a simple sequence that prints a welcome message in several languages, character by character, with a slight delay between each one. This feature simulates a real-time typing effect, which also helps verify the correct functioning of the execution environment and the libraries used—in this case, as shown, the time module from Python.

This exercise aims to help me understand and reinforce the software creation process while becoming familiar with good development practices. This includes using control structures and incorporating pauses, which can be useful for enhancing the user experience or simulating asynchronous processes.
